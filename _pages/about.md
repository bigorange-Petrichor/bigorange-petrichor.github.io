I received my B.E. degree from Qingdao University, China in June 2018.
In the same year, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in Nanjing University under the supervision of <a href="https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html" target="_black"> Prof. Qing Gu.
Currently, I am working with <a href="https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html" target="_black"> Prof. Qing Gu</a> and <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/jzw/" target="_black"> Assistant Researcher Zhiwei Jiang</a> for a Ph.D. degree.
